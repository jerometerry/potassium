Sodium.net
==========

Sodium.net is a port of (the Java implementation of) [Sodium](https://github.com/kentuckyfriedtakahe/sodium) to C#.

[Sodium](https://github.com/kentuckyfriedtakahe/sodium) is a Reactive Programming Library that has been implemented in several languages including Haskell, Java, C++, Embedded-C, and Rust. 

However, there was no implementation for .NET. Hence this project.
